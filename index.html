<p>About a third of my income goes to keeping my girls supplied with sparkly, cute pencils without which they would not be able to learn a <em>single thing</em> at school.</p>

<p>So, why, whenever I see them doing their homework, do they always seem to be scraping away at the paper with tiny pencil stubs like this?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On July 24, when Japanese TV stations stopped analog broadcasts, I&#8217;d done nothing to get our TV system digital-ready. I&#8217;m not the biggest TV fan. The prospect of not having it for a while was about as daunting as imagining life without SPAM. I reckoned I&#8217;d have to pay for a tuner, an antenna, and for someone to come out and install it. I was sure it would be expensive, time consuming and end up with me feeling somehow ripped off.</p>

<p>We were in Australia at the end of July so it wasn&#8217;t an immediate problem. And even when we got back at the end of the month it was fine. If the kids wanted to watch something really badly they went to their grandmother&#8217;s house and watched it there. I knew it was something I&#8217;d have to take care of someday, though. On a Sunday near the end of August I took a deep breath and decided to do what needed doing.</p>

<p>Less than an hour later we were up and running. It didn&#8217;t cost a thing.</p>

<p>The first happy surprise was finding out that our TV, though rather old, was already digital-ready. That meant I wouldn&#8217;t have to get a tuner.</p>

<p>I headed out to the balcony to take a look at the antenna and wiring. I was somewhat incredulous when I saw that there was actually a UHF antenna perched on top of the VHF one.</p>

<p>Where did <em>that</em> come from? I know <em>I</em> didn&#8217;t buy it. It must&#8217;ve been sitting there unused and unloved since we bought the house twelve years ago.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, after messing about with cables and TV settings a bit, we were good to go. All the noisy variety shows, irksome melodramas, and screechy singing programs you could ever hope to watch were back for our viewing pleasure in vibrant high-definition.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What&#8217;s going on here?</p>

<p>When I put my MacBook to sleep, Safari (in full-screen) is the active application. When I wake it up it immediately switches to the Finder or some other non-full-screen app.</p>

<p>The same thing happens with every other full-screen app.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve asked the kids, my wife, and the cat and none of us can come up with a reason why that should happen.</p>

<p>Bug? Feature? Just me?</p>

<p>&#8212; Update: August 12&#8212;</p>

<p>I learned today that switching on wake doesn&#8217;t only happen with full-screen apps. It happens all the time. That the internet is not aflame with complaints about this (I can find none) makes me suspect that the problem is local. But I installed Lion on top of a pristine Snow Leopard. What more can I do?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Every time our cat slips through our defenses and gets outside she sets to eating some leaves. When she comes back she invariably throws up the leaves and whatever else is in her stomach. She doesn&#8217;t seem to enjoy it very much.</p>

<p>You may not be able to teach an old dog new tricks. I wonder if cats are even capable of learning?</p>

<p>The first time I write something on Twitter it is almost always more than 140 characters long. I contract what I can, delete pronouns, pluck out adjectives and remove modifiers until I get there.</p>

<p>I trim, I snip, and I twist. Writing on Twitter is like being a bonsai gardener.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1995 I wrote my first and only fan letter. It was to Dave Berman, leader of the Silver Jews. A couple of months later I got a reply from him written on a plain ole index card.</p>

<p>Heady times.</p>

<p>Berman <a href="http://www.weeblackskelf.co.uk/cordsuit/">broke up the Silver Jews</a> last year and decided to quit the music business. At the time he said he was considering moving on to &#8220;screenwriting or muckraking.&#8221; Looks like he decided to give the blogging thing a try too.</p>

The kid I was teaching asked what it was. I didn’t know, I’d just chosen a playlist called ‘Cello Music’, so I told her it was the radio. She seemed to accept that but, at the end of the lesson she said something odd in Japanese.</p>
