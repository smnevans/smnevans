  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve developed an odd speech impediment; the inability to say the word &#8220;not&#8221;. I want to tell my wife that we do <strong>not</strong> need a MacBook Air, that I do <strong>not</strong> want one, and that we can <strong>not</strong> afford it. Every time I try, the words come out wrong. Her responses, &#8220;Really?&#8221;, &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;, and &#8220;Well, ok, if you think it&#8217;s that important.&#8221; are entirely want I don&#8217;t want to hear.</p>

<p>Maybe I should see a doctor. I don&#8217;t want to be too hasty though. I think I&#8217;ll wait and see if this affliction actually results in a MacBook Air in my hands. Then I&#8217;ll see a doctor.  Yeah, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do.</p>

I bought mine months ago, it&#8217;s easy to put on, easy to keep clean and makes the iPad so much nicer to use. The Japanese version comes with a cloth for wiping it down but it seems like the American version may not.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I once dreamed of having a small box in the living room to hold all our movies and music.</p>

<p>The Apple TV that was released four years ago would have given that to me but I didn&#8217;t buy it.</p>

<p>At first it seemed a little expensive. Later it seemed like an update would be <em>just around the corner</em>. I didn&#8217;t want to be the guy who bought an iPod mini the day before the iPod nano was released.</p>

<p>Last week the long awaited update finally came.</p>

<p>And gosh!</p>

<p>The new Apple TV is so entirely the opposite of what I want that I immediately went out and bought one of the old ones.</p>

<p>The new one isn&#8217;t <em>bad</em>. It may well be exactly what Apple should do at this point. But here in Japan we don&#8217;t have Netflix or any  movies for sale or rent on Tunes at all. The new Apple TV isn&#8217;t even available here and the old one has been discontinued. It&#8217;s no longer available online but should still be in Apple Stores for a little while.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve only had it for a little while but I think it&#8217;s great. I&#8217;m still messing about with Handbrake and ATVflash but I think the day that I won&#8217;t have to nag the kids (or myself) to put the DVDs away is just around the corner.</p>

<p>The Apple TV is dead!</p>

<p>Long live the Apple TV!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Kazuo Ishiguro&#8217;s novel, <em>Never Let Me Go</em>, is brilliantly paced to slowly reveal the truth about the characters and their world.</p>

<p>The film may be similarly well-paced but it hardly seems to matter. <em>Everything</em> is revealed (and explicitly stated) in the trailer.</p>

<p>Who makes these things?
How many layers of approval do they go through?
Why would anyone think it was a good idea to give away so much?</p>

<p>I came home for lunch today, put my key in the lock, and it <em>snapped off</em> about a centimetre and a half  from the tip.</p>

<p>It was a shock but, with hindsight, not so surprising. It was more than ten years old and the lock is a bit dodgy. It needs a bit of jingling and jangling to get open at the best of times.</p>

<p>A few millimetres of the broken edge hung from the hole, not enough for my fingernails to grasp.</p>

<p>I managed to find an old pair of rusty tweezers at my mother-in-law&#8217;s house but although I have petite, girly hands I&#8217;m really not good with small, fiddly stuff. I thought there was a pretty good chance that I would end up pushing the broken fragment unreachably deeper into the lock. I&#8217;d end up spending several hundred dollars on a locksmith visit and more on a new lock and keys.</p>

<p>I have to learn to take it easy. On my first try I got a good hold on the chunk of key and it slid out easily.</p>

<p>The steamy summer interior of my hallway has seldom seemed so welcoming. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Something that I&#8217;ve not seen mentioned accurately in any reviews is the appearance of an  &#8220;Edit User Dictionary&#8221; option in the Keyboard Settings. It appears if a Japanese or Chinese - Pinyin keyboard is selected.</p>

<p>Many people, seeing it, have assumed that it is a way to add words to the auto-correction or spelling dictionary. It is not.</p>

<p>The user dictionary is designed to help people writing Japanese or Chinese. It allows users to pre-set which Chinese characters appear when they type a phonetic version of a word. It&#8217;s commonly used for names of places and people and is a standard feature of most character based input systems and, as such, is a very welcome addition to iOS.</p>

<p>Entering words in here will neither add them to the auto-correct dictionary, stop them from being underlined in red or enable any Text Expander like features.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Update: iOS 4.2 allows spell-checking to be turned off while leaving auto-correction on. This solves the problems mentioned in this post. Yay!</strong></span></p>

<p>The auto-correction feature on the iPhone still amazes me. I can blaze away with both thumbs and ninety percent of the time it will correctly guess what I&#8217;m trying to type. I&#8217;ve been tapping away at little mobile screens for a decade now and have never felt so comfortable inputting text.</p>

<p>The iPad and iOS 4 have introduced a new trick. The system automatically spell checks your text and underlines errors in red. If you&#8217;ve used Word or any recent Mac it will be instantly familiar to you. Tap on an underlined word and choose the correct one. Simple as pie.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a good idea but it is not implemented very well. Here are the main problems:</p>

<p><strong>There&#8217;s no easy way to tell the system to learn or ignore a word.</strong>
I&#8217;m finding that almost every time I write an email or a note something gets flagged as an error that isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s just a word that the dictionary doesn&#8217;t know. Names of people and places are commonly flagged, as are most Japanese words.  I think I <strong>should</strong> be able to teach the system the word from the little contextual menu that pops up but it&#8217;s not possible. I get a message saying &#8220;No Replacement Found&#8221; but no way to remove the red line. What I <em>can</em> do is add a new contact to the Contacts app with the flagged word as the name. It&#8217;s a time consuming piece of hackery that feels completely out of place on the iPad.</p>

<p><a title="Travel Plans by smnevans, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simonevans/4724280214/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1360/4724280214_61fb33e23c.jpg" alt="Travel Plans" width="500" height="149" /></a></p>

<p><strong>You can&#8217;t turn off spell checking globally without also losing auto-correction.</strong>
I tried going without auto-correction for a while on my iPad but found it so cumbersome that I decided that I&#8217;d rather put up with red squiggles strewn throughout my text than go without it. The idea of using my phone without it is just ridiculous.</p>

<p><strong>Spell checking can&#8217;t be turned off on an app by app basis.</strong>
Apple&#8217;s iWork programs have an easy to find toggle for spell checking. This, apparently, is not available to third party developers. It seems that someone at Apple realized that not everyone would want spell checking on all the time. It&#8217;s a pity that other developers don&#8217;t have the chance to do the same thing.</p>

<p><a title="iWork spelling toggle by smnevans, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simonevans/4723628603/"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1177/4723628603_7a27e6682d.jpg" alt="iWork spelling toggle" width="500" height="238" /></a></p>

<p>Here are some things Apple could do to fix spell checking:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Allow users to add words to the dictionary right from the contextual menu. This seems like the most sensible option to me and what I think most users would expect to be able to do.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow users to turn off spell check separately from auto-correction. I really hoped this would be addressed by iOS 4 but, alas, it is not.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow developers to add a spell check toggle to their programs. This is the least attractive option. It would add work for developers and also for users who would have to find the toggle somewhere. It could get confusing pretty fast with people losing track of where they do or don&#8217;t have it enabled.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Apple worked for two years to get copy and paste working just right. They probably could have introduced a half-baked implementation along with the original iPhone or iPhone 3G but they didn&#8217;t. They kept working on it till it felt just right. I wish they had shown the same care in building the spell check feature. It&#8217;s still early days yet for both the iPad and iOS 4. I hope that Apple do something to make spell check easier to use sooner rather than later.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was reading the end of Neil Gaiman&#8217;s &#8216;Neverwhere&#8217; last night when I noticed a hat tip to William Gibson. As Richard Mayhew emerges from London Below he sees:</p>

<blockquote><p>The sky was the perfect untroubled blue of a television screen, tuned to a dead channel.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s an echo of the first line of William Gibson&#8217;s &#8216;Neuromancer&#8217;:</p>

<blockquote><p>The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nice.</p>

<hr />

<p>I&#8217;ve read that line of Gibson&#8217;s dozens of times in articles over the last twenty years. It&#8217;s a lazy quote; the first line of the first novel, and universally well regarded. But there is so much more.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently been reading &#8216;Pattern Recognition&#8217; again and have been amazed by the power and inventiveness of Gibson&#8217;s language as he introduces us to Cayce Pollard.</p>

<p>Damien:</p>

<blockquote><p>Damien is a friend. <br>
Their girl-boy Lego doesn&#8217;t click, he would say.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jet lag:</p>

<blockquote><p>She knows, now, absolutely, hearing the white noise that is London,
that Damien&#8217;s theory of jet lag is correct: that her mortal soul
is leagues behind her, being reeled in on some ghostly umbilical
down the vanished wake of the plane that brought her here, hundreds
of  thousands of feet above the Atlantic. Souls can&#8217;t move that
quickly, and are left behind, and must be awaited, upon arrival,
like lost luggage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Her new black 501s</p>

<blockquote><p>… every trademark carefully removed. Even the buttons on these
have been ground flat, featureless , by a puzzled Korean locksmith,
in the Village, a week ago.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s just in the first few pages. I last read &#8216;Pattern Recognition&#8217;, partly in paperback and partly as an audiobook, a few years ago during a really stressful time. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lot I missed. Looking forward to finding out what.</p>

<hr />

<p>Both Neil Gaiman and William Gibson are active Twitter users. Gaiman as <a href="http://twitter.com/neilhimself">@neilhimself</a> and Gibson as <a href="http://twitter.com/GreatDismal">@GreatDismal</a>. They both seem very nice and surprisingly responsive to questions and comments.</p>
