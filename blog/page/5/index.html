  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Pavement. Terror Twilight Tour. Tokyo. 1999 or 2000.</strong></p>

<p>I was scared of being caught but more scared of being left out. So, when my friends jumped onstage and walked backstage in search of Pavement&#8217;s dressing room, I followed. Less than a minute later we were there, beers in hand, chatting with Pavement. My favorite band ever.</p>

<p>I was terrified and felt really uncomfortable. Part of the reason for this was that I was an uninvited guest. Meeting the people who make the sounds that have been in your head almost every day for the last five years is strange enough. Meeting them when they have no idea who you are or why you are talking to them is even stranger. Maybe I&#8217;m too sensitive.</p>

<p>My memories are hazy but two are clear:</p>

<p><strong>Memory One</strong></p>

<p>I asked Steve Malkmus if he was bothered that Pavement CDs in Japan shipped with very odd translations of the lyrics. He said that the English versions weren&#8217;t much better. I realise that it was a fairly lame question to ask but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d do much better if I found myself in the same situation today.</p>

<p><strong>Memory Two</strong></p>

<p>An annoyed woman came in and demanded to know who the hell we were and how we had gotten backstage. Our sheepish looks made it pretty clear that we were not actually the opening band (as had been thought). It looked as if we were about to get thrown out when Malkmus came to our rescue and said that it was okay for us to stay until they all left. I thought that was pretty nice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hiking on Mount Ikoma today I came upon a group of firemen training. They were standing on a bridge practicing lowering people into the valley below and raising them up again.</p>

<p>As soon as they saw me coming they started shouting &#8220;Pedestrian coming through! Pedestrian coming through!&#8221; As I passed each one they <em>saluted</em>. Not a sarcastic salute either. Backs straight. Crisp movements. It was accompanied by a shouted apology for getting in the way.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><div id="_mcePaste"><a title="Orbital Site" href="http://www.orbital-game.com/">Orbital</a> is hard. In Pure Mode (the one, true mode) my higest score is only 37 points. I feel like I earned every single one of those points.</div>


<p>Most games give you 100 points for doing X, 200 for doing Y and 400 for doing Z. Pretty soon your score creeps into the thousands or tens of thousands and becomes fairly meaningless.</p>

<p>The great thing about Orbital is that every point counts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m reading in the bath. It’s steamy and the water is up to my neck. I notice that the phone is getting pretty steamed up and try to dry it off with a towel. The more I try to dry it the wetter it gets. I notice a splashing sound.</p>

<p>It’s full of water.</p>

<p>I shake the phone and water splashes about inside. I can’t get the water out though. I realise that the phone is still on and frantically try to turn it off. It won&#8217;t turn off. It sounds like I&#8217;m shaking a half full bottle of water.</p>

<blockquote>Home
Is where I want to be
Pick me up and turn me round</blockquote>


<p>Talking Heads’ <em>This Must be the Place</em> (my alarm ringtone) wakes me and ends the terror.</p>

<p>This was my second dream of iPhone destruction of the week. The other was simpler. I just knocked it to the floor and smashed the screen. Good thing I don’t believe that dreams mean anything or I’d be worried, but I don’t, so I’m not, and if you see me checking out waterproof cases in Yodobashi Camera this weekend it has <em>nothing</em> to do with this dream. It’s just something I’ve been meaning to look into for a while. Really.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Although I really, really liked Battlestar Galactica. I didn&#8217;t like new BSG movie: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286130/">The Plan</a>. I wish I&#8217;d never seen it, that it had never been made.</p>

<p>Some of the dialogue was good. Dean Stockwell&#8217;s performance was great. The basic concept, telling the story of the cylon attack and its aftermath from the cylon&#8217;s point of view, is an interesting one.</p>

<p>However, instead of telling a new story (as they did in Razor) they weave this one in with the story we have already seen.The new material doesn&#8217;t enrich that story, it dilutes and lessens it. I&#8217;m pretty good at suspending disbelief but I just couldn&#8217;t do it while watching this. I couldn&#8217;t convince myself that in the story I had already seen, Cavil and the other cylons were lurking, undiscovered, just outside of camera range. I don&#8217;t believe that the things we see happen here actually happened.</p>

<p>I hope that rumours of plans to make more BSG movies turn out to false. If not, I hope their stories only intersect the one we already know and avoid trying to run in parallel with it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I signed up for the <a href="http://infinitesummer.org/">infinite summer</a> but soon stopped following what people were saying while they read the book. It seemed pointless. After a couple of hundred pages it&#8217;s pretty clear that this is a book that can&#8217;t really be talked about until it has been read. Now I wonder if there&#8217;s any point saying anything about it until it has been read twice.</p>

<p>The first time through was often fun but sometimes a little like work. The second time around is a joy.</p>

<p>I started reading the paperback. About 200 pages in I stopped for a while. It just seemed to big to carry around. Whenever I had time to read it I didn&#8217;t have it. A couple of weeks later I bought an ebook copy for Stanza on the iPhone. That&#8217;s when I really started to get into it. They released an update (to Stanza) recently that makes jumping back and forth between the footnotes and the main text much faster. Not zippy though. It takes about five seconds to go to a footnote and about one to head back. For the last 300 pages I was switching back and forth between the paperback and the iPhone a few times a day.</p>

<p>Reading the paperback I sometimes caught myself skimming. I found it easier to focus on the text on the phone. This time I&#8217;m doing most of my reading on the iPhone. I really want to savour the words.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Watched Wall-E again with the kids this evening. This time around it really seemed like a kids movie.<em> This is a good thing.</em> Too many movies that are ostensibly for kids try to appeal to adults or teenagers by including elements of pop culture or pop psychology. An example of this is the horrible Chicken Little. Wall-E has a simple story. The characters have simple motives. I far prefer this to the kind of fake depth and &#8220;darkness&#8221; that have made the Harry Potter films so unpleasant.</p>

<p>I remember that when it was released some people questioned whether a film with so little dialog would appeal to children. On second viewing this seems even more ludicrous than it did last year. I can’t imagine any dialog in the first half of the movie that wouldn’t be totally redundant and distracting.</p>

<blockquote>Here, I am … Lonely Wall-E …

Only a cockroach for a friend …

Wow! What’s that light? …

Hey! That&#8217;s hot!

Hmmm, she’s hot.”</blockquote>


<p>So much is communicated in their gestures and expressions that I actually think Eve and Wall-E talk a little too much.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.etymotic.com">Etymotics Research</a> has some new eartips. They are called Gliders and are shaped like small mushrooms. Having read some <a href="http://www.whatsoniphone.com/blogs/little-things-make-big-difference-etymotic-glider-eartips">glowing reports</a> about their sound quality I wanted to try them out.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t find them in any shops here in Japan so I emailed Etymotics asking if they knew of a Japanese source. Their response suprised me: they sent me a pair for free.</p>

<p>A week later they sent me two more pairs. A mistake perhaps but a very nice one.</p>

<p>They have the best sound of any of the eartips I have tried so far. Detailed, rich and warm. They fit nicely in my cavernous ears. They don&#8217;t block out quite as much noise as the flange eartips but I only notice it when I am in my school.</p>
